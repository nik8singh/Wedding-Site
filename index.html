                        Nikhil, being one of the better programmers in class, tutored some of the students in college, I was one of them. In spite of our different personalities and interests, we connected over our mutual love for pencil sketches and eventually became close friends. With his
                        adventurous and outgoing personality, he brings out a part of me that I never knew existed.

Communication was key, even with our busy schedules we discussed everything under the sun, from favorite movies to our fears, frustrations, and future. It wasn't
                        always easy but we learned to trust each other and that made us realize that we are ready for a life together.
